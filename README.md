## Scenes (located in _Scenes in assets folder)
NATM - Main Scene
OutdoorOffice - navigable
ShirtStore - navigable
Fears - navigable
ApartmentScene - navigable

## Hidden button
To reset the user prefs for keeping track of where the camera was (so you return to where you were in the scene when coming back from navigable scenes) I put a hidden button at the bottom middle of the welcome screen. If after you've gone through you want to reset so you appear at the welcome menu use that.
